**Deck-building scripts for Cards Against Humanity-style games on playingcards.io**

See interactive version of this page here: LINK

## Background

My team uses board game sessions to break up long days and keep in touch while working remotely. I adapted some of our favorites for video calls without folks having to install stuff or make new accounts.

Cards Against Humanagement wrangles official Cards Against Humanity card text from REPO and then offers 1) diagnostics for balancing a deck with your custom additions; 2) file exports for uploading to [playingcards.io](http://playingcards.io/docs/overview) for instant, live multiplayer.

[Business Insider has a good tutorial](https://www.businessinsider.com/cards-against-humanity-virtually-online-video-chat-how-to-play-2020-3) for configuring a game, but I was interested in crafting my supplemental cards to align with the syntactic balance of the Cards Against Humanity base deck and supplements, which [Chris Hallberg helpfully cataloged.](https://github.com/crhallberg/json-against-humanity)

## Get selected CAH decks from json-against-humanity
https://github.com/crhallberg/json-against-humanity/tree/master/src

```{r}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo=TRUE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE)
opts_dt <- list(scrollX=TRUE)

suppressPackageStartupMessages({
  library(dplyr)
  library(stringr)
  library(scales)
  library(DT)
})

source("utils.R")

jah_dir    <- dir("json-against-humanity/src", full.names = TRUE)
jah_picks  <- grep("Base\\>|CAHe", jah_dir, value=TRUE)
custom_dir <- "custom/management"

# named list makes life easier later
decks <- c(lapply(jah_picks, import_deck) %>% setNames(basename(jah_picks)), 
           list(management=import_deck(custom_dir, black_file="prompts.txt", white_file="responses.txt"))
           )

megadeck <- bind_rows(decks)

decks <- c(decks, list(all=megadeck))

# names(decks)

# Benchmarks
bench <- lapply(decks, benchmark_deck, "benchmark") %>% bind_rows %>% {.$deck <- paste0(names(decks), ""); .}
bench_sfw <- lapply(decks, benchmark_deck, "benchmark", censor_regex=nsfw) %>% bind_rows %>% {.$deck <- paste0(names(decks), "_sfw"); .}
bench_all <- bind_rows(bench, bench_sfw)

# these are standalone but best mech to combine/mix and match?
```

The base deck has a 16:84 ratio of black to white, while the expansions are close to 25:75. 

My "custom" deck is somewhere in between in size, which a 50:50 ratio. It seems like to maintain balance, you probably want a ratio closer to 25:75. 

Looks like the 6th expansion's black cards are primarily single fill-in-the-blanks as opposed to questions or pick 2+s. Was this meant to rebalance the cumulative base+expansions?

```{r}
bench %>% datatable(options=opts_dt,
                    caption = htmltools::tags$caption(
      style = 'caption-side: top; text-align: left; line-height:3.5rem; font-size:2rem',
      htmltools::strong('Benchmark stats for CAH decks, select expansions, my custom deck, and the cumulative megadeck')
    )
)
```

## Censor cards for job security

Most of the CAH cards are SFW if not juvenile, but some would raise eyebrows. 

```{r censored}
nsfw_entries <- lapply(decks, benchmark_deck, "df", censor_regex=nsfw, filter_df=FALSE) %>% bind_rows %>% 
  filter(remove == TRUE) %>% 
  select(text, Label, src)

nsfw_entries %>% 
  datatable(
    options=list(opts_dt, scrollY="400px"),
    caption = htmltools::tags$caption(
      style = 'caption-side: top; text-align: left; line-height:3.5rem; font-size:2rem',
      htmltools::strong('NSFW text')
    )
  )
```

## How do deck benchmarks change after censorship?

You lose 40-50% of the cards

```{r}
bench_all %>% 
  datatable(options=opts_dt,
    caption = htmltools::tags$caption(
      style = 'caption-side: top; text-align: left; line-height:3.5rem; font-size:2rem',
      htmltools::strong('Default cards and SFW cards')
    )
  )
```

## See how your new cards mesh with the canonical cards

Here I've filtered to only my new white cards and all black cards


<div class = "row">
<div class = "col-md-6">
```{r black,  warning = FALSE, echo = FALSE, dev=c('svg')}
# constrain height and make inf scroll
decks_sfw <- benchmark_deck(megadeck, "df", censor_regex=nsfw) %>% mutate(src=as.factor(basename(src)))
decks_sfw %>% filter(Label=="Black") %>% select(text, src) %>% datatable(filter="top", options=list(opts_dt, scrollY="300px", pageLength=nrow(.)))
```
</div>
<div class = "col-md-6">
```{r white, warning = FALSE, echo=FALSE, dev=c('svg')}
decks_sfw %>% filter(Label=="White") %>% select(text, src) %>% datatable(filter="top", options=list(opts_dt, scrollY="300px", pageLength=nrow(.)))

# custom_whites <- decks_sfw %>% 
#   filter(src == "custom/management" & Label == "White" | Label == "Black")
# 
# datatable(sample_deck(custom_whites), options=opts_dt)

```
</div>
</div>


## Output CSVs for playingcards.io upload
```{r output}
# write.csv(deck_sfw, "deck_sfw.csv", row.names = FALSE)
# write.csv(deck_sfw %>% filter(Label == "Black") %>% select(Label, prompt), "playingcardio_prompts.csv", row.names = FALSE)
# write.csv(deck_sfw %>% filter(Label == "White") %>% select(Label, response), "playingcardio_responses.csv", row.names = FALSE)
```
